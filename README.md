# Gene Expression Programming (GEP) in Dart

This is an independent implementation of the Gene Expression Programming (GEP)
machine learning algorithm created by Dr. CÃ¢ndida Ferreira.
It was written in the Dart programming language by Glenn Lewis (https://keybase.io/gmlewis).

Here is a concise summary of GEP:

## Status - Work-in-progress

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goals

* Learn Dart 2, GEP, and machine learning using GEP
* Solve all the [OpenAI Gym][] machine learning challenges in Dart
* Compare results with Go and Elixir versions

[OpenAI Gym]: https://gym.openai.com/

## Why Dart?

There are a number of reasons for using [Dart][]:

* Dart is easy to read and understand,
* [dartfmt][] (and its integration with text editors) is fantastic,
* Dart has generics,
* Dart has excellent type inference to reduce code boilerplate,
* Dart compiles relatively quickly especially after the initial build,
* due to Dart's strong typing, if your code compiles, chances are good
  that it is correct, and
* Dart makes programming fun again.
